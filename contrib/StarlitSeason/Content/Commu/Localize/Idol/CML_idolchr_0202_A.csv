世界中にアプローチするのもアリじゃない？","","You don't have to stick to Japan,
Isn't it possible to approach the whole world?","","We don't have to limit ourselves to Japan. Doing 
events all over the world is also good, right?",""

杏はスケールの大きいことを考えるんだな","","I see.
Apricots think on a grand scale.","","I see what you mean.
Anzu, you think about things in a great scale.",""
