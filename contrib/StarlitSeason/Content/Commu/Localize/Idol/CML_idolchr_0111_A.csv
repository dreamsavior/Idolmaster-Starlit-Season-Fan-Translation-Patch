That's why Ami tried wearing perfume, too!","","Kaori onee-chan smelled really nice.
That's why Ami tried on perfume!"
"どう、いい匂いがする？
亜美ってば、せくしーで大人っぽいー？","","How do I smell?
Ami is so sesquicentennial and mature?","","How is it? Does it smell good?
Ami, are you sexy and mature-?"
"だから、そうじゃなくてな……。
まず打ち合わせは明日だろ、今日じゃないぞ","","So, that's not what I meant. ......
First of all, the meeting is tomorrow, not today.","","Like I said, that's not what I meant...
The meeting's tomorrow, not today"
"ええっ！　間違えちゃった！？
大人な亜美でもミスはするんだね、ドンマイマイ☆","","What! I made a mistake!
Even mature Ami makes mistakes, don't you know?","","Whaaat!? Did I get it wrong!?
Even an adult like Ami makes mistakes, huh? Don't worry, don't worry☆"
"ま、明後日と勘違いしてお仕事行かないよりは
いいっしょー！","","Well, it's better than mistaking it for the day after tomorrow and not going to work.
That's good, isn't it?","","Well, it's better than not going
to work the day after tomorrow!"
"ポジティブだな……。それから香水がキツすぎる。
いい匂いどころか、気持ち悪くなるレベルだぞ","","Positive. ....... Then the perfume is too harsh.
Not only does it smell good, it's a Level that makes you sick.","","She's so positive......And her perfume is too harsh.
It's not just a nice smell. It's disgusting."
"えー！　そうなの！？
服にどばっと気前よくかけてきたのに！","","Oh, really?
I had generously poured a lot of it on my clothes!","","Whaaat!? Really!?
And here I thought you'd be generous enough to put it on my clothes!"
"今、なんて？","","Now what?","","What did you just say?"
"だからぁ、服に香水ドバーってかけたの！
いっぱいかけたほうがいい匂いでしょ？","","So, I put a dab of perfume on my clothes!
It smells better when you put a lot of it on, doesn't it?","","That's why I sprayed perfume on your clothes!
It smells better if you put a lot on it, right?"
"それでこの匂いか……。
亜美、香水はそんな使い方をするもんじゃないぞ","","So this is what it smells like. ......
Ami, don't use perfume that way.","","So that's why it smells like this...
Ami, you shouldn't use perfume like that."
"ええーっ？　じゃあじゃあ、どうやって使うの？
服じゃないなら……頭にかけるとか？","","What? Well, then, how does it work?
If not clothes, maybe a ...... headband?","","Whaaat? Then how do you use it?
If you're not wearing clothes......why don't you put them on your head?"
"兄ちゃん！　香水の使い方、教えて！","","Brother! Teach me how to use perfume!","","Brother! Teach me how to use perfume!"
"香水の使い方か……","","How to use perfume or ......","","How to use perfume, huh..."
"少しだけつけるんだ","","Put some on.","","Turn it on a little bit."
"手首につけるんだ","","Put it on your wrist.","","Put it on your wrist."
"大人には程遠いな","","You're a long way from being an adult.","","You're far from mature."

ふんわり香りがするくらいにしておくんだよ","","Put just a little bit on, on your wrists, on your neck,
It's supposed to be softly fragrant.","","Put it on just a little. Put it on your wrists
and neck, and make sure it smells nice and soft."

ドバーッじゃなくて……ちょっとだけ？","","Ew! Perfume is like that!
Not a dobber, just a little bit of ......?","","Whaaaat!? Is that how perfume works!?
Not 'thwack'... Just a little"
"ああ、自分で匂いが分かるくらいつけると、
周りからすればきついくらいだぞ","","Oh, if you put it on so that you can smell it yourself,
It's so much tougher to get around.","","Yeah, if you put it on yourself enough to smell
it, it'll be pretty hard on the people around you"
"うあうあ～！　亜美、自分でもきついなって
思ってたけど、これが大人のスタイルかな～って！","","Ami, you said it was too hard even for you.
I was thinking, maybe this is the adult style!","","Aaaaah! I thought Ami was tough on herself,
but I thought this was her mature style!"
"ふんわり香るくらいか……。
これぞワビサビってやつだね！","","It's about as softly scented or .......
This is what I call wabi sabi!","","I guess it's enough to give off a light fragrance......
This is what they call rusting!"
"教えてくれてありがと、兄ちゃん♪
亜美、また大人になっちゃったな～","","Thanks for telling me, bro... ♪
Ami, you've grown up again!","","Thanks for telling me, bro♪
Ami, you've grown up again."
"手首とか肌につけるんだ。
服につけたら染みになったりするぞ","","You put it on your wrists or on your skin.
If you get it on your clothes, it can stain them.","","Put it on your wrists and skin.
If you put it on your clothes, it will get stained."

亜美、また大人になっちゃったな～","","Perfume is put on the wrist or something, right?
Ami, you've grown up again!","","You wear perfume on your wrists and stuff.
Ami, you've grown up again."
"でも兄ちゃん、お肌に香水つけたら、

Won't it get all over my body?","","But if you put perfume on your skin,
won't it make your whole body wet?"
"いや、量は加減してくれ……","","No, you can add or subtract the amount: ......","","No, hold back on the amount..."
"そんな使い方をしていちゃ大人には程遠いな","","You're a long way from being an adult if you're using it like that.","","You're far from an adult if you're using it like that."

You put a little bit on your wrist or your neck or something.","","No, no, I'm not going to drink it. I'm going to
put a little perfume on your wrists and neck."
"ちぇー。内面からいい匂いがするって、大人っぽい
って思ったのにな―。いおりんも言ってたし！","","Wow, smelling so good from the inside is so mature!
I thought, ""What's wrong with that?","","Tch. I thought you smelled nice on the inside, so
I thought you were mature. Iorin said so too!"
"内面っていうか、全体で匂いを発しているけどな。
あと伊織が言ってたのは、そういう意味じゃないぞ？","","I mean, I smell it on the inside, or rather, the whole thing, though.
And that's not what Iori meant, okay?","","It's more like she's giving off a scent on the inside.

できればレッスンウェアとかに着替えてきてくれ","","Anyway, Ami is a smell bomb now,
Go change into your lesson clothes or something if you can.","","Anyway, Ami's a smell bomb now, so if you
can, please change into your lessonwear."
"そんなにー！？

I went to the trouble of putting on perfume to make it look more mature. ......","","That many-?!
I put on some perfume to make it look more mature..."
"いいか、亜美。大人は見た目やマネをしてなるもの
じゃない、考え方や心、中身のものが大事なんだ","","Listen, Ami, adults are what they look like and what they become.
It's not about what you think, it's about what's in your mind, your heart, what's inside that counts.","","Listen, Ami. Adults aren't meant to look and act like adults,
they're meant to have a way of thinking, a heart, and what's inside."
"そもそも大人のミリキばかり気にしているけど、
亜美の本当のミリキって、それなのか？","","To begin with, though, I'm only concerned about adult Miriki,
Is that the real Miriki of Ami?","","I'm always worried about adult Miki,
but is that really the real Miki Ami?"
"そんなこと言われたって……亜美こそ聞きたいよ～！
みんな、違うとかダメとか言うばっかりで……","","I'd love to hear you say that ...... Ami is the one I want to hear it from!
Everyone just says different or no. ......","","Even if you say that... Ami wants to hear it too~!

"亜美だって、よく分からなくなるよー！","","Even Ami gets confused!","","I don't even know what you're talking about anymore, Ami!"
"（亜美も悩んでいたのか……！）","","(Ami was also troubled by ......!)","","(Ami's worried, too...!)"
"悪かった、亜美は真剣に考えてたんだな。
俺も今一緒に考えてみるよ","","My bad, Ami must have been taking it seriously.
I'll figure it out with you now too.","","I'm sorry, Ami was thinking seriously.
I'll think about it with you now."
"あれ、兄ちゃんでもすぐ答えは出ないんだ？
なんだ、亜美と一緒じゃん☆","","Oh, even my brother doesn't get an answer right away?
What? You're just like Ami!","","Huh? You don't have an answer right away?
Oh, you're with Ami☆"
"つまりー、今、亜美と兄ちゃんは亜美のミリキに
ついて、悩みに悩んでる仲間ってことだね","","So - now Ami and her brother are in Ami's Miriki.
I guess that means we're all friends in trouble.","","In other words, Ami and Onii-chan are
friends who are worried about Ami's Miki."
"うん、よく分からないけど、そういうことに
しておこっか☆","","Yeah, I don't know, but that's what I'm trying to do.
I'll do it.","","Yeah, I don't really get it,
but let's leave it at that. ☆"
"どういうことなんだ……。
というか切り替えがはやいな……","","What does that mean? .......
I mean, you switch so fast. ......","","What's going on here......?
Man, she sure switched gears quickly..."
"とりあえず亜美は着替えてくんね～","","In the meantime, Ami, go change your clothes.","","Anyway, ami, get changed."
"うーん、思ってたよりも大人のミリキの道って
イバラでトゲトゲなんだなー……","","Hmmm, the way of the adult Miriki is more than I thought it would be.
You're a spiky, spiky thing with thorns. ......","","Hmm, I didn't think the path of
adult Miki would be so thorny..."
"（亜美だって悩みながら模索しているんだ。
こんな時こそ俺が道を示してあげたい……）","","(Even Ami is searching for it, worrying about it.
It's times like this I wish I could show you the way (......)","","(Ami is also worried as she tries to find something.

Ami is on a trip, please don't look for her.","","Hmm... A wandering trip?
Ami, you're on a journey. Don't go looking for her."
"いや探さないでも何も……もう見つけた後だしな","","No, I'm not looking for it, but I'm not going to look for it or anything. ...... after I've already found it.","","No, I won't. But I've already found it."
"むむっ！？
兄ちゃん、それはカラアゲ取りだよー！","","Mmm!
Brother, that's karaage-taking!","","Mmm!?
That's fried chicken, mister!"
"カラアゲ……ああ、揚げ足取りのことか。
いや、それよりどうしたんだ？","","Kalaage...... Oh, you mean fried.
No, what's more important?","","Fried chicken...? Oh, you mean the fried chicken?

I was just thinking about adult Miriki: ......","","Hmm... Ami... I've been thinking
about adult Miki again..."
"そしたら、頭がぐるぐるしてきたんだよー。
だからお散歩してたの","","Then my head started to spin!
So I took a walk.","","And then my head started spinning.
That's why I was taking a walk."
"大人のミリキ、亜美的にチョー頑張ったのに～。
どーすれば身につくの～？","","Adult Miriki, I did my best to be Ami-like chooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
How can I learn to do this?","","Even though the adult Miki tried so hard to be like Ami...
How can I learn that?"
"せくしーなポーズもお色気ムンムン香水も違うん
だったら、もう亜美、分かんないよ～！","","The sexy pose and the sexy perfume are different.
Then, Ami, I don't know anymore!","","If the sexy poses and sexy perfumes are
different, then I don't know anymore, Ami!"
"悪い、真剣に考えてたのに気付いてやれなかったな。
俺も一緒に……","","Sorry, I didn't realize you were being serious.
I'm with you ......","","Sorry, I didn't realize I was thinking seriously about it.
I'll come with you..."
"亜美、兄ちゃんの言ってることが
一番ぐるぐる迷宮入りしちゃうんだよ～","","Ami, what my brother is saying.
I get lost in the most roundabout way.","","Ami, what you're saying is
the most unsolved of all "
"兄ちゃんの言ってた『中身』って、
おにぎりで言ったら『具』ってことでしょ？","","My brother was talking about 'substance',
If you say ""onigiri"", you mean ""garnish"", right?","","When you say '  Inside  "",' you
mean   Gu  "" onigiri, right?"
"そしたら、『見た目』は『白いご飯』だよね？","","Then the 'look' is 'white rice,' right?","","Then,   Looks  "" is   White rice  "", right?"
"そんでそんで、具もご飯もどっちも、
おにぎりには大事だよねー？","","And then, both the ingredients and the rice,
It's important for onigiri - right?","","And so, both the rice and the
ingredients are important for onigiri, right?"
"だから亜美、まずはご飯をビッグにしよーって
思ったんだけど、それって間違えてるのかな？","","So, Ami, let's make a big meal first.
I thought, is that a mistake?","","That's why I wanted to make the rice
big first, Ami. Am I making a mistake?"
"そこまで間違えてはいないけど……。
そうだな、なら、おにぎりで言うと、今の亜美は……","","I'm not that wrong, but .......
Well, then, in onigiri terms, Ami is now ......","","I'm not that wrong, but...
That's right, then, in terms of onigiri, the current Ami is..."
"バランスが悪い","","imbalanced","","It's unbalanced."
"具が決まっていない","","The ingredients are not set in stone.","","There's no filling."
"具がないおにぎり","","Onigiri without ingredients","","Onigiri without fillings"
"具とご飯のバランスが悪い。このままだと亜美は、
具が少なくてご飯ばっかりのおにぎりになるぞ","","The balance between the ingredients and the rice is not right; if it continues like this, Ami,
You'll end up with a rice ball with few ingredients and all rice.","","The rice and the ingredients aren't balanced. At this rate,
Ami will only end up eating rice balls with so few ingredients."
"具が少なくてご飯ばっかりのおにぎり！？
それは一大事！　大事件だよ、兄ちゃん！","","Onigiri with few ingredients and all rice!
That's a big deal! It's a big deal, brother!","","There aren't many ingredients, and all you get is rice balls!?

"あれ？　亜美のお腹がぐーぐーなりだした。
これはおにぎりを食べないと解決できないっぽいよ","","Ami's stomach started growling.
This sounds like you need to eat a rice ball to fix this.","","Huh? Ami's stomach started to growl.
It looks like we won't be able to solve this unless we eat onigiri."
"じ、自由すぎる展開だな。
おにぎりは後で食べるとして……","","Ji, that's too free a development.
I'll eat the rice balls later. ......","","Th-That's a pretty free-spirited development.
I'll eat onigiri later..."
"具がきちんと決まってないんじゃないか？
どんな具を選ぶか、結構大事だと思うけどな","","I'm not sure the ingredients are properly defined.
I think it's pretty important what ingredients you choose.","","The ingredients haven't been properly decided, have they?
I think it's pretty important to choose the ingredients."
"た、たしかにー！　亜美探偵ってば大事なヒントを

We're not done talking yet.","","Wh-What's been resolved!?
I'm not done talking yet."
"具を決めた後はご飯の仕事だ。どっちもバランスよく
揃ってこそ、美味しいおにぎりになるだろ？","","Once you've decided on the ingredients, it's time to work on the rice, both of which need to be balanced.
It's only when they're all together that they make a good rice ball, right?","","After we've decided on the ingredients, we'll have to work on the
rice. We'll both be good onigiri if we keep our balance, right?"
"おにぎりは、ご飯と具のバランスが大事ってこと？
確かにおいしいおにぎりは、バランスがいいかも……","","So onigiri is all about the balance between the rice and the ingredients?
Surely a good rice ball could be a good balance: ......","","Does that mean the balance of rice and ingredients is important for onigiri?
It's true that delicious onigiri are well-balanced..."
"今の亜美は、具がないおにぎりになるんじゃないか？
亜美が育てているのはご飯、外見だけに聞こえるぞ","","Now Ami would be a rice ball with no ingredients.
Sounds to me like Ami is raising you rice, just for looks.","","Right now, wouldn't Ami turn into an onigiri without any fillings?
Ami, you're raising food. It's just how you look."
"亜美、具はまだ入れてる最中だよ～！
これから入れるもん！","","Ami, the ingredients are still being added!
I'm going to put it in now!","","Ami, the ingredients are still in the middle of putting them in~!
I'm gonna put it in now!"

At this rate, Ami will turn into a weird onigiri!","","In that case, I'll have to think about what's inside.
