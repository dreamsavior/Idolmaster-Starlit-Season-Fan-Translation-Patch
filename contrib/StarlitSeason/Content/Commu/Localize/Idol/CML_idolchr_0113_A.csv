"さっそくですが、ルミナスのプロデュース方針は、
どういったものを考えているんですか？","","Quickly, what is Luminous' production policy?
What do you have in mind?","","So, Luminous, what kind of production
policies do you have in mind?"
"レッスンと同じように、ルミナスは個性を
大事にしていく形でプロデュースしていこうと思う","","Like the lessons, Luminous is about individuality.
I'm going to produce it in a way that will be important.","","Just like during lessons, I'm going to
make sure Luminous values her Quirk."
"レッスンもペースは個人に合わせてって話でしたね。
プロデュース方針もその方向性ってことですか？","","You also said that the pace of lessons should be tailored to the individual.
Does that mean your production policy is also in that direction?","","You said you wanted to pace your lessons at a personal pace, right?
Are you saying that's the direction of the production policy too?"
"ああ、そうだな。無理に枠に当てはめるんじゃなく、
それぞれの個性を活かしたいんだ","","Yeah, I agree, don't force it into a box,
I'm trying to bring out the individuality in each of them.","","Yeah, that's right. We don't want to force ourselves to
apply it, we want to make use of our individual personalities."
"それぞれの個性を……。
でも、そんなことができるんですか？","","Each has its own personality. ......
But how is that possible?","","Each individuality......
But can you really do that?"
"うちの事務所も個性が強い子たちばかりですけど、
他の事務所の子たちだって負けていません","","Our office is full of kids with strong personalities, though,
Even the other kids in the office are no slouches.","","Our agency has a lot of strong personalities,
but the others at our agency are no less talented."

他のメンバーに教えてやってくれないか？","","So talk to Ritsuko...a Ritsuko kind of perspective and way of thinking,
Could you tell the other members?","","So I'll talk to Ritsuko about it. Could you teach the
other members how to see and think like Ritsuko?"
"え？　私の考え方、ですか……？","","What? My way of thinking, is it ......?","","Huh? My way of thinking...?"
"律子はセルフプロデュースをしてきただろう？
アイドルが自分の個性を理解しつつ……","","Ritsuko has been self-producing, hasn't she?
While idols understand their individuality, ......","","Ritsuko's been self-producing, right?

"それを活かして自身をプロデュースする。
そんな感性をみんなにも持ってもらいたいんだ","","Produce yourself by making the most of it.
I want everyone to have that kind of sensitivity.","","He took advantage of this to produce his own production.
I want everyone to have that kind of feeling."
"そうですね……セルフプロデュースの観点を
持つことには、賛成ですが……","","Yes, ...... self-production perspective.
I'm all for having a ......","","Well, I do agree with the
self-produce angle, but..."
"個性が磨かれるのはいいとしても、
みんな思い思いに動いて、衝突しちゃいません？","","Even if it is good for the individuality to be refined,
Doesn't everyone move as they wish and clash with each other?","","It's one thing to have your Quirks polished, but don't you
think they're all moving as they please and clashing?"
"そのぶつかりが、ルミナスの魅力に繋がると
俺は信じている","","That the clash will lead to the attraction of luminous
I believe in it.","","I believe that collision will
lead to Luminous's charm."
"…………。わかりました、プロデューサーが
そう言うなら、やってみます","","............. Okay, Producer is
If you say so, I'll try.","","...Okay. If Producer
says so, I'll give it a shot."
"任せたぞ。これは律子にしか頼めないことだからな","","You got it, because this is something only Ritsuko can ask you to do.","","I'm counting on you. This is something only Ritsuko can do."
"もう、すぐそう言って持ち上げようとするんだから。
でも……うーん、個性か……","","They already try to lift you up by saying so right away.
But ...... hmmm, individuality or ......","","Geez, she's about to say that and lift me up.
But... Hmm, individuality..."
"参考までに聞きたいんですが、
プロデューサーは私の個性ってなんだと思います？","","I'd like to ask for your information,
What do producers think my personality is?","","Just for reference, what do you
think is my Quirk as a producer?"
"律子の個性か。そうだな……","","The personality of the law. yes. ......","","Ritsuko's Quirk, huh. Let's see..."
"意外とお調子者","","Surprisingly good-natured","","You're a lot more of a clown than I thought."

"かと思えば、みんなをしっかり引っ張ったりする
一面もあるよな","","On the other hand, he also pulls everyone along with him.
There's a side to you, isn't there?","","I thought so, but she's also the
type who pulls everyone along."
"そうですか？
普通な気もしますけど","","Is that so?
I feel like it's normal.","","Is that so?
I think it's normal."
"そんなことない。後輩たちはもちろん、
あの亜美と真美の世話をしているんだぞ？","","No, of course not...not to mention the juniors,
You know, taking care of that Ami and Mami?","","That's not true. My juniors are taking
care of Ami and Mami, of course."
"ふたりの世話をできる人なんて、そういない。
お調子者のリーダー！　律子の誇るべき個性だ！","","Not many people can take care of both of them.
A well-behaved leader! Ritsuko is proud of her personality!","","There aren't many people who can take care of them.
The leader of the fools! That's Ritsuko's pride and joy!"
"そう言われたら、そんな気がしてきたかも？
乗せられている感はありますけどね","","Now that you put it that way, I might have a feeling that's what you're getting at?
I do feel like I'm being taken for a ride, though.","","Now that you mention it, I think I'm starting to feel that way.
I feel like I'm being carried away."
"律子といったら、やはり眼鏡キャラだろう。
外しているところなんて、見たことないしな","","Ritsuko is, after all, a character with glasses.
I've never seen you take it off.","","Ritsuko's probably a bespectacled character.
I've never seen her take it off before"
"ま、まあ、お風呂と寝る時以外は、
絶対に外さないようにしてますが……","","Well, well, except for bathing and sleeping,
I'm trying to make sure I never miss it. ......","","W-Well, I make sure not to take it off
when I'm not sleeping in the bath..."
"眼鏡キャラなんて安直すぎますよ。
もうちょっと頑張って考えてください","","A character with glasses is too easy.
Think a little harder.","","A bespectacled character is too cheap.
Try to think a little harder."
"そ、そうか。立派な個性だと思ったんだが……","","Oh, well, I thought it was a fine character trait: ......","","I-I see. I thought it was a splendid Quirk, but..."
"こうして的確に突っ込んでくれるし、
律子はしっかり者で真面目だよな","","And they go right into it like this,
Ritsuko is solid and serious.","","Ritsuko's so diligent and diligent, and she's
always been able to charge in with such precision."
"うーん……律子の個性、個性……","","Hmmm ...... Ritsuko's personality, individuality ......","","Hmm... Ritsuko's Quirk, Quirk..."
"そんなに迷って、まさか思いつかないなんて
言いませんよね？　私のプロデューサーなのにっ！","","I can't believe you were so lost and couldn't think of anything.
You won't say it, will you? You're my producer!","","You're not going to tell me you can't think
of anything, are you? You're my producer!"
"も、もちろんだ！　律子の個性は……そうだ！
意外と怒りっぽいところ！","","Ritsuko's personality is ......!
A surprisingly angry place!","","O-Of course! Ritsuko's Quirk... That's right!
She's surprisingly quick to anger!"
"それ、短所じゃないですか？
もう少し真面目に考えてくださいよ","","Isn't that a shortcoming?
You need to take this a little more seriously.","","Isn't that a weakness?
Please think a little more seriously."
"どんなミスも見逃さず、厳しいレッスンを行う。
鬼軍曹で決まりだな！","","He does not overlook any mistakes and gives strict lessons.
It's all about the devil's sergeant!","","I'll give her a strict lesson, without missing a single mistake.
It's settled then, Sergeant Demon!"
"『決まりだな！』じゃないですよっ。
亜美や真美じゃあるまいし、真面目に考えてください","","It's not ""It's settled!
You're not Ami or Mami, take it seriously!","","『It's decided!』That's not what I meant!
I'm not Ami or Mami, so please think about it seriously."

律子の個性は……お調子者なところだ！","","Sorry, I thought it was funny. ......
Ritsuko's personality is ...... a good-natured one!","","S-Sorry, I thought you'd like it...
Ritsuko's Quirk... She's so full of herself!"
"お調子者なところは事実ですけど……
この流れで言われると納得しにくいですね……","","The good-natured part is true, but ......
It's hard to agree with what you say in this stream: ......","","It's true that he's a bit of a weirdo, but...
It's hard to accept that when you put it like this..."
"まあ、とにかく。
私も自分の個性、大事にします","","Well, anyway.
I too value my individuality.","","Well, anyway.
I'll treasure my Quirk, too."
"アドバイスする側なのに、
みんなの個性に埋もれたら意味がありませんからね","","I'm the one giving advice,
It would be meaningless if we were buried in everyone's individuality.","","I'm giving you advice, but there's no point if you're just
going to let everyone's individuality get the better of you."
"それと、やるからには手加減しません。全力で
いくので、覚悟してくださいね、プロデューサー！","","And, I'm not going to go easy on you if you do it.
I'm going to be there, so please be prepared, producer!","","And I won't hold back. I'll give it
everything I've got, so be ready, producer!"
