comedy routine, but I don't think it suits you, Chihaya."
"……それは私にお笑いのセンスがない
ということでしょうか","","...... it's me with no sense of comedy

have no sense of humor?"
"それであれば、尚更お笑いの勉強をしていく
必要があるのではないかと","","If that's the case, I'll study comedy even more.
I'm not sure we need to.","","If that's the case, then perhaps it's
all the more reason to study comedy."
