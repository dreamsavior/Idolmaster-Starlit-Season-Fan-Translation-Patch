best to bring you something to eat, too"

応援するのもせんぱいの仕事かも、って思ったり","","Besides, I hope everyone is doing well and doing their best.
I sometimes think that it might be the job of the senpai to support them.","","And I thought it might be your job to
cheer everyone on so they can do their best."
"レッスンだって……。
でも、もしかして無理、してたんでしょうか。私","","Even the lessons are available at .......

いつの間にか自分のことができなくなってて……","","I tried my best to do it right,
Before I knew it, I couldn't do my own thing. ......","","I tried my best to do it right, but
before I knew it, I couldn't do it anymore..."
"うぅ……自分のことができてないのに、
せんぱいなんて、おかしいですよね？","","Ugh ...... even though I can't do my own thing,
Senpai is funny, isn't it?","","Ugh... It's weird that you can't
do it yourself, Senpai."

何が悪かったのか、自分でわかっているんだろう？","","Yay, you care too much.
You know what went wrong, don't you?","","Yayoi, you're worrying too much.
