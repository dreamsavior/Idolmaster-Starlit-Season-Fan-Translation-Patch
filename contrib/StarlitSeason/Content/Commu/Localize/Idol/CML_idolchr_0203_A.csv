I don't want to get separated from you. I think it's better that way.","","I guess that's true.
It'd be bad if we got separated, so I guess it was for the best that way."

good idea to go on an adventure. We can check that out later if you want"
"美嘉はやっぱり詳しいんだな。
じゃあおすすめのお店から行ってみようか","","Mika is still an expert on the subject.
Well, let's start with your recommendation.","","You really know your stuff, don't you?

I'm getting a feel for it.","","Even Luminous feels like
I'm doing pretty well."
"でも、ここがゴールって気は全然しないんだよね。
むしろここから！　ってカンジ","","But I don't feel like this is the goal at all.
It's more like, ""Here we go!","","But I don't feel like this is the goal at all.
Actually, it's more like 'From here!"
"ああ、ルミナスは美嘉からいい刺激を受けてるし、
俺も美嘉とまだまだやってみたいことがあるよ","","Yeah, Luminous is getting good inspiration from Mika,
I still want to do more with Mika, too.","","Yeah, Luminous is being stimulated by Mika.
There's still a lot I want to do with you too!"
"……っ！　うん、アタシ、まだやってないこと

I believe in Mika's effort and ability.","","I think it's okay to believe her.
I believe in mika's strength and effort."
"ふふ……プロデューサーってば、アタシのこと、
信頼し過ぎじゃない？","","Hmmm......... producers, you know, Atashi,
I think you trust him too much.","","Heheh... Don't you think the
producer trusts me too much?"
"でも……めちゃくちゃ嬉しいかな。
アタシを信じてくれる人がいるって、心強いよね","","But I guess I'm really happy with .......
It's reassuring to have someone who believes in me, isn't it?","","But... I'm really happy.

"あはは、それはそうだよね。
ってか、未来のアタシにも分かんないかも","","Haha, that's true.
Or maybe even my future self won't know.","","Haha, I guess you're right.
Actually, I might not even be able to figure it out in the future."
"だって、未来のアタシもきっと
もっと大きい夢見てるはずだし","","Because I'm sure that future Atashi will too.
And I'm sure you're dreaming bigger dreams.","","Because I'm sure that in the future,
my dreams will be even bigger."
"美嘉が努力した分だけ、信じていいんじゃないか？","","You can believe in Mika as much as she tries, can't you?","","Isn't it okay to trust her for the amount of effort she put in?"
"う～ん……アタシが努力すればするほど、
アタシのこと信じられるってこと、かな？","","Hmmm ...... the more I try,
Does that mean you can trust me?","","Hmm... The more effort I put in, the
easier it is for you to trust me."
"確かに、努力すれば夢が叶うってわけじゃないけど、
努力しないと叶うものも叶わないもんね","","Sure, it doesn't mean that if you work hard, your dreams will come true,
If you don't work hard, you won't get what you want.","","It's true that if you work hard, your dreams won't come to fruition. But it also means something can
never be granted without working harder too much as a result of the effort involved in making them happen"
"美嘉の言う通り、もっと活躍できるはずだ。
夢は大きいほうがいいからな","","Mika is right, we can be more active.
Because the bigger the dream, the better.","","Just as Mika said, I should be able to do more.
The bigger you dream, the better."
"ありがと、プロデューサー。
やっぱプロデューサーの真っ直ぐな言葉、効くなぁ","","Thanks, producer.
I knew Producer's straight words would work.","","Thanks, producer.
Producer's straightforward words really do work."
"でもさ、夢は大きい方がいいけど……。
それってどこまで大きくなるんだろうね……","","But hey, the bigger the dream, the better. ......
I wonder how big that will get: ......","","But you know, the bigger my dream is...
I wonder how big they'll get..."
"って、ちょっとセンチになりすぎかな。
アタシらしくないよね","","I guess that's a little too sentimental.
It's not like me.","","Wait, maybe I'm getting a little too sentimental.
It's not like me, is it?"
"そんなことない。
夢ってきっとそういうものなんだよ","","
I'm sure that's what dreams are for.","","That's not true.
That must be what dreams are like."
"遠くて、大きくて、叶わないような気がしても、
それでも手を伸ばしてしまうものなんだと思う","","Even if it seems far away, big, and unattainable,
But I think it's still something you reach for.","","It's so far away, and big. Even if it feels like you
can never reach out your hand to someone else..."
"……そっか、そういうものなんだね。
アタシ……ちょっと怖気づいちゃってたのかな","","...... I see, that's how it works.
I guess I was getting a little scared of Atashi ......","","...I see, so that's how it is.
Maybe I was getting a little scared."
"アタシね、自分が目指してるものが、
もうどうしようもなく遠くにある気がしてたんだ","","Atashi, what I'm aiming for,
I just felt like it was too far away to do anything about it anymore.","","You know, I felt like the thing that was
my goal had already gone so far away."
"いろんなアイドルに会って、ライブも経験して、
アタシの夢って届かないとこにあるのかなって","","I met various idols and experienced live performances,
I wondered if my dreams were out of reach.","","I've met all kinds of idols, experienced concerts...
Maybe my dreams are somewhere that can never reach them."
"なんとなくだけどさ、
そんなカンジがしちゃってた","","Somehow,
I was getting that feeling.","","It's just a hunch, but that
was the impression I got."
"美嘉が感じてることも間違いじゃないんだろうな","","I guess there's no mistaking what Mika feels.","","You're not wrong about what you feel too, right?"
"でも、その場所を目指そうとする気持ちが、
美嘉をナンバーワンにさせてくれるんじゃないか？","","But the desire to try to get to that place,
I think they will let Mika be number one.","","But, wouldn't the desire to
go there make her number one?"
"そっか、そうだよね！　届かない夢なんてないよね！
今までも遠い夢に手を伸ばしてきたんだもん","","I see, that's right! There is no such thing as an unreachable dream!
We've been reaching for distant dreams all this time.","","That's right! There are no dreams that can never be reached, huh?
I've always reached out to distant dreams."
"アタシ、やっぱりどんな瞬間も、
ナンバーワンでオンリーワンのアタシでいたい！","","Atashi, after all, any moment,
I want to be the number one and only one Atashi!","","I want to be number one and
the only me, no matter what!"
"この気持ちが、アタシのことをアゲてくれる！
アタシの原動力になってるんじゃん！","","This feeling is aggravating to me!
You are the driving force behind Atashi!","","This feeling will get me fired up!
You're my driving force!"
"アタシ、そういうアイドル目指すから、
改めてこれからもよろしくね、プロデューサー！","","That's the kind of idol I'm aiming for,
Once again, keep up the good work, producer!","","That's the kind of idol I want to be,
so please continue being my producer!"

I want to see Mika's dazzling future with you.","","Yeah, I'm counting on you too.

夢を叶えていくところ、見ててよね★","","Of course, I'm going to take care of it from now on.
Watch me make my dreams come true, won't you?","","Heheh, of course. Just watch me
fulfill my dreams from now on! ★"
"（美嘉と次の仕事に向かう途中で呼び止められた）","","(I was stopped on my way to my next job with Mika)","","(Mika and I were on our way to work when she stopped us.)"
"プロデューサー、ネクタイ曲がってるよ","","Producer, your tie is crooked.","","Your necktie's crooked, producer."
"ちょっと立ち止まって、直してあげる。
……はい、できた！","","I'll stop for a moment and fix it.
...... Yes, it's done!","","I stop for a moment and fix it.
...Okay, done!"
"ありがとう。
いつも気を使ってもらってばっかりで、悪いな","","Thank you.
I'm sorry for always taking care of you.","","Thank you.
Sorry for always making you worry about me."
"そんなのお互い様だし。ってか、プロデューサー、
ずっとそんな風に思ってたの？","","I mean, producer,
Have you always felt that way?","","That goes for both of us. Wait, has
Producer always thought that?"
"うん、まあ……。俺は美嘉に大したことしてやれて
ないと思うし。むしろ頼ってばっかりだしな……","","Yeah, well, ......, I didn't do much for Mika.
I don't think so, and I'd rather just rely on you. ......","","Yeah, well... I don't think it was a big deal for her. In fact all she
does is rely on me too much to do anything else at the moment ..."
"はぁ……。もう、何言ってんの？
いい、今からアタシが言うことよーく聞いてよね","","Huh. ....... What are you talking about already?
Okay, now listen to what I'm going to say.","","Hah... Geez, what are you saying?
Look, just listen carefully to what I'm gonna say."
"アタシにとってプロデューサーの期待が
１番のパワーになるんだから★","","For me, Producer's expectations are
It's the number one power source.","","For me, Producer's expectations
are going to be my greatest power! ★"
"もちろん、ファンのみんなの応援もそうだし、

As well as the inspiration we receive from other idols. ......","","Of course, I'll be cheering you on from the fans
and getting a kick out of other idols..."
"でも、プロデューサーが期待してくれてるって
思ったら、なんだってうまくやれる気がするんだ","","But Producer said he's counting on me.
I feel like I can do anything I put my mind to.","","But if Producer has high hopes for you,
I feel like we can do anything well."
"ううん、『やってやろう！』って、
パワーが湧いてくるんだよね","","No, he said, ""Let's do it!
It gives you power, doesn't it?","","No, 『Let's do this!』
has a lot of power."
"そういうカンジ、プロデューサーにもある？","","Do you have that feeling, producer?","","Do you have a producer's opinion of that, too?"
"パワーが湧いてくる時か。
そうだな……","","Is it a time of power?","","It's time for power to well up.
Yeah, you're right"
"美嘉に頼られた時","","When Mika asked me for help","","When mika relied on me"
