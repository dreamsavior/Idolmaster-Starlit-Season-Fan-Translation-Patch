The scripts assume you are following similar folder structures to KingKrouch's project space on his google drive.
To setup everything...

If you have never touched the Commu-Kit before:
1. Modify the last line in Export_EngPatch.bat to point to your StarlitSeason installation folder
2. Run Export_UAssets.bat
3. Translate stuff from the CSV files generated from the Commu-Kit
4. Run Export_EngPatch.bat to compile translations


If you have used the Commu-Kit before to export stuff or have made translations with the Commu uassets:
1. Move all the CSVs you have modified to another location (ex: desktop)
2. Redownload a fresh copy of the "pakchunk99-EngPatch\StarlitSeason\Content\Commu\Localize" folder and its contents
   from KingKrouch's IM@S SS translation google drive.
3. Completely delete that same folder on your PC
4. Extract the contents of the downloaded copy from Google drive into the same folder that was just deleted.
5. Modify the last line in Export_EngPatch.bat to point to your StarlitSeason installation folder
6. Run Export_UAssets.bat
7. Move the modified CSVs back into their respective folders and replace the ones that currently exist in there.
8. Continue to translate stuff from the CSV files generated from the Commu-Kit or what you had before
9. Run Export_EngPatch.bat to compile translations
